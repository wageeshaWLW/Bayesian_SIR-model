Bayesian SIR Model

The Bayesian SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model with change points is an advanced epidemiological model designed to analyze and predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, while accounting for significant changes in transmission dynamics over time. This model incorporates Bayesian inference and change point detection to adapt to varying transmission and removal rates, providing a more flexible and accurate depiction of disease spread compared to traditional SIR models.

Key Components and Concepts

SIR Model: The standard SIR model divides a population into three compartments:

Susceptible (S): Individuals who can contract the disease.
Infected (I): Individuals who have contracted the disease and can spread it.
Removed (R): Individuals who have either recovered from the disease or died, and are no longer infectious.
Each individual is assumed to be in one state at ant time.
